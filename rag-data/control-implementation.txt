Conduct regular phishing simulations and track employee training completion rates.

Asset Inventory
Maintain an updated asset register including owners, classification, and lifecycle status.

Vulnerability Management
Perform regular vulnerability scans, prioritize based on CVSS score, and track remediation SLAs.

Define detection, containment, eradication, and recovery steps with clear roles and escalation paths.
