Privileged Account Abuse
If administrators share root credentials, accountability is lost and malicious actions may go undetected. Recommended controls: A.9 Access Control, privileged access monitoring, and session recording.

Shadow IT
Employees using unauthorized SaaS tools can expose sensitive data outside organizational visibility. Controls: asset inventory, cloud access governance, and acceptable use policies.

Unmonitored Logs
If logs are generated but not reviewed, security incidents may remain undetected. Controls: centralized logging and automated alerting.

Weak Vendor Security
A third-party vendor with weak security may become an attack entry point. Controls: supplier risk assessments and contractual security requirements.

No Incident Playbooks
Organizations without defined incident playbooks may respond inconsistently during breaches. Controls: incident response planning and tabletop exercises.

Overprivileged Access
Users with excessive permissions increase blast radius of compromise. Controls: least privilege enforcement and periodic access reviews.
