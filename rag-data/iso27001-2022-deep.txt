ISO 27001:2022 Control Structure
ISO 27001:2022 reorganized Annex A into 4 domains: Organizational, People, Physical, and Technological controls.

Organizational Controls
Focus on governance, policies, supplier relationships, and risk ownership. Example: defining roles for risk acceptance and ISMS governance.

People Controls
Covers awareness training, disciplinary processes, and insider threat mitigation.

Physical Controls
Includes secure areas, environmental controls, and protection against physical intrusion.

Technological Controls
Covers logging, monitoring, access control, malware protection, and configuration management.

Control Integration
ISO 27001 controls should not operate in isolation. For example, access control must integrate with HR onboarding and offboarding processes.

Risk Treatment Planning
Controls must be selected based on risk assessment outcomes, not implemented blindly.

Statement of Applicability (SoA)
Organizations must justify which controls are included or excluded and provide rationale aligned with risk treatment.

Continuous Improvement
ISMS must follow PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle with periodic reviews and internal audits.
