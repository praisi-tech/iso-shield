ISO 27001 Audit Best Practices

Risk-Based Approach
Audits should prioritize high-risk assets and processes rather than treating all controls equally.

Evidence Collection
Auditors should gather objective evidence such as logs, policies, and screenshots.

Control Effectiveness
Not only check if controls exist, but verify if they are effective in practice.

Least Privilege Principle
Ensure users only have access necessary for their role.

Continuous Monitoring
Security should be continuously monitored, not only during audits.

Management Support
Top management commitment is critical for ISMS success.

Documentation Quality
Policies should be clear, updated, and aligned with actual practices.

Incident Readiness
Organizations should demonstrate incident detection and response capability.

Third-Party Risk
Vendors should be assessed for security risks.

Audit Trail
Maintain clear documentation for audit traceability and accountability.
